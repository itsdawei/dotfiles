# Novelty Search

## [Desperately Searching for Something](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361142547_Desperately_Searching_for_Something)

More recently it has been argued that, even without setting any technical
objectives to be optimised, the aim of novelty search itself does indeed assert
some _meta objectives_: those of fully searching a parameter domain (with
possibly unknown constraints) for novel or radical mechanisms while not missing
possibilities through an incomplete search, leaving unexplored holes.

According to [Doncieux et al., 2019](https://hal.science/hal-02561846/document),
NS behaves like a uniform random search process within the parameter space.

Novelty detection: Create a model of normality with observations, then deploy
a metric derived from that model and allowing for variability. One identifies
incoming anomalous observations that are extreme or unexpected.

We will look at procedures for sampling domains that might engender wide
coverage (diversity), while at the same time creating a relatively uniform
sampling density.
