# daweiOS

Let's build daweiOS!

## Currently

### Main Applications

- OS: [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)
- Desktop Environment: [hyprland](https://hyprland.org/)
- Status Bar: [waybar]()
- Terminal: [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) + [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
- Shell: [fish](https://fishshell.com/)
- Editor: [neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- Browser: [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
  - Lags when playing videos
- File Manager: [dolphin](https://apps.kde.org/dolphin/)
  - But I really prefer to use [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)

## Other things that I want

### Music Player

Currently I use Apple Music so I can't use a local version on my laptop.
Maybe this warrants a switch to Spotify.

### Cava

Current I run CAVA in the background of my desktop, which is cool but sometimes annoying.
I can move it into the status bar.

_Then, set up a keybind that shows the desktop on all monitors and launch Cava._

### eww

- **Eww sounds like a lot of work but might be the next thing to try. It also replaces waybar.**
    - https://github.com/dharmx/vile/tree/main
- Implemented Dashboard that shows a todo list.
- Implemented a quote widget.
    - TODO Replace quote database with my own.
